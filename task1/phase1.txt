Task:
Client/Server application to see user screens on remote host.


Client has to make "print-screen" each 60 seconds.

All screens must be stored in client app folder.

Each screen name consists of date, when it has been taken + number of screen.

Ex: 21.07.2018_15.png 21.07.2018_16.png ...etc

Server can request screens by those names.

File must be transferred to server via 5555 port.



Implementation plan:
1) Implement a program that takes a screenshot of the screen and 
saves it to a file in "bmp" format.

with using these libs:

#include <windows.h>

#pragma comment (lib, "gdiplus.lib")

#include <gdiplus.h>
#include <stdio.h>



2) Upgrade the program so that the screen is made every 60 seconds and 
saved in "jpeg" format, named "hh:mm:ss.№".



3) Implement the server.
(a program on a remote computer that performs certain tasks and can send different requests to clients)



4) Add the server the ability to request screenshots from the first program by name.
